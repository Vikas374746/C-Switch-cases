### **Experiment 5: Use of Switch Case in C++**

**Title of the Experiment:**
To study and implement switch-case control structure using C++

**Objective / Aim:**
To understand the use of the `switch` statement to perform multi-way branching for various user inputs, such as:

* Mapping numbers to weekdays
* Performing arithmetic operations

**Tools Used:**

* Code::Blocks IDE or Visual Studio Code
* GCC Compiler (MinGW or g++)
* Operating System: Windows or Linux

---

### **Theory:**

The `switch` statement in C++ is used for decision-making where a variable or expression is compared with multiple constant values. It allows execution of different code blocks based on the matched case.
Each `case` ends with a `break` statement to prevent fall-through. If no case matches, the `default` block executes.

**Key Concepts:**

* Control flow
* Switch-case syntax
* Multi-way branching
* Input/output handling
* Arithmetic operations

---

### **Programs Covered:**

1. Display weekday name based on number input (1 to 7)
2. Perform basic arithmetic operations using switch-case

---

### **Algorithm (Weekday Program):**

1. Start the program
2. Input a number between 1 and 7
3. Use switch-case to match the number
4. Display the corresponding weekday
5. If the number is invalid, show an error message
6. End

---

### **Algorithm (Calculator Program):**

1. Start the program
2. Input two numbers and an operator
3. Use switch-case on the operator to determine operation
4. Perform the appropriate calculation
5. If division, check if divisor is not zero
6. Display the result
7. End

---

### **Flowchart (Text Description):**

**For both programs:**
Start → Input → Switch on value → Match case → Perform action → Display result → End

---

### **Conclusion:**

The switch-case structure was implemented successfully to solve both selection-based and arithmetic problems.
This experiment helped understand control structures and how to simplify complex `if-else` chains using switch statements.
